# CS219
My CS219 class projects. I am in no way an professional assembly language programmer, this repo is to keep as a record my classwork and it is not meant to demonstrate any sort of significant PROFESSIONAL understanding of assembly.

Introduction to organization and integration of computer components. Topics include: computer abstractions and
performance, arithmetic operations, instruction set architecture, assembly programming, datapath, pipelining, memory
hierarchy, I/O, and parallel architectures.
