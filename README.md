# CS219
My CS219 class projects. This repo is to keep as a record my classwork and show the programs I made in my CS219 course. Tools I used are NASM and DOSBox for the Intel x86 architecture. I also used Eclipse for the ARM7 processor arhcitecture.

Introduction to organization and integration of computer components. Topics include: computer abstractions and
performance, arithmetic operations, instruction set architecture, assembly programming, datapath, pipelining, memory
hierarchy, I/O, and parallel architectures.
